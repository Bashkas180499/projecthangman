# projecthangman
This project was developed by the engineers at AiCore. This is a hangman project which is a classical game and fun for all ages.
The main aim of this project is practicing some of the basic Python functions. There are 3 methods in this project: ask_letter method, __init__ method and check_letter method.
This is a command line application and can be used on Python3.

A template was provided with different #TODO tasks, all must be completed and if a nice prompt with you heading on the right direction.

Milestone 1
In this project, we'll use GitHub to track changes to our code and save them online in a GitHub repo. Hit the button on the right to automatically create a new GitHub repo. We'll tell you when we need to use it as we go through the project.

Milestone 2
Each milestone you will see in this project corresponds to at least one line starting with #TODO, so for example, for milestone 1, you need to replace those lines that start with #TODO 1. For milestone 2, you need to replace those lines that start with #TODO 2, and so on
Your task is to replace the lines starting with # TODO 1 in your code. By replacing those lines, you will complete the ask_letter method, which, as the name suggests, will ask the user for a letter. Another line you will need to complete is inside the play_game function, where you will call the ask_letter method.
Remember that, to call a function, you can simply write the name of the function followed by parentheses (play_game() for example), but if you want to call a method, you need to type the instance first followed by the name of the method (game.ask_letter() for example)
After you finish, when calling ask_letter, the user will be asked to enter a letter. Test it yourself, and make sure that, when you enter more than a single character, you will get asked to enter a single character.

Milestone 3
Carefully, read the docstring of the class and make sure you understand what each attribute is.
Set all of the attributes required within the initialiser.
The docstring is a string that is used to describe the class. It is used to help you understand what the class is used for.
The attributes have to be named using the same names as the ones in the dosctring.

Milestone 4
Completing any last minute checks as well as finishinh the ask_letter method to see if input is valid.
